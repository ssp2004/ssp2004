### About Me
I have a year of professional experience translating data into insights that can be put to use, and I am an enthusiastic data analyst. I enjoy delving into data to find patterns, trends, and narratives that inspire creativity and decision-making. Statistical analysis, data visualisation, and dashboard creation that makes data accessible and helpful to all are among my areas of competence.
